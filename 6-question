Banking works by transferring money from account A to account B. Most of the time account A is in one bank while account B is another bank. Suppose someone writes an implementation for such a money transfer.
 1. What are the test cases? 
2. What are the issues in such a system? 
3. What can we do to mitigate some of the issues ?
 4. Write the code yourself to demonstrate the mitigations.

Solution:-
#TESTCASES:
1.input -1=  500
Expected output =  500 Transferred  from  Bank_A(Account_A) to Bank_B( Account_B)
{‘ACCOUNT_A’:500,’ACCOUNT_B’:1500}

2.input = 10000
Expected output = “Insufficent funds”
Your output = “Insufficent funds”

3.input = 1000
1000 Transferred  from  Bank_A( Account_A) to Bank_B(Account_B)
{‘ACCOUNT_A’:0,’ACCOUNT_B’:2000}

4.Input = 1200000
Expected output = “Transcation limit exceeded”
Your output = “Transcation limit excceded”

5.input = 500
  If passing account_C  has value 
Expected output = NameError
Your output = NameError
 
2.
-Network Issues
-over transaction
-Invalid user issue


3.
- Using appropriate network while tranfering the amount
-should transfer amount with in the transcation limit
-valid user is allowed to make transfer amount


4.code-
class BankTransfer:
    Banks={}
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name
        BankTransfer.Banks[self.name] = 0
    def deposit(self,amount):
        BankTransfer.Banks[self.name] += amount
    def withdraw(self,amount):
            BankTransfer.Banks[self.name] -= amount
    def transfer(self,reciver,amount):
        if amount > 100000:
            print("Transcation limt excceded")
        elif amount>BankTransfer.Banks[self.name]:
            print("Insufficent funds")
        else:  
            if  BankTransfer.Banks[self.name]:
                self.withdraw(amount)
                reciver.deposit(amount)
                print(str(amount)+" Transfered from Bank_A(Account_A) to Bank_B(Account_B)")
                print(BankTransfer.Banks)
account_A = BankTransfer('ACCOUNT_A')
account_B = BankTransfer("ACCOUNT_B")

account_A.deposit(1000)
account_B.deposit(1000)

transferAmount = int(input())
account_A.transfer(account_B,transferAmount)
